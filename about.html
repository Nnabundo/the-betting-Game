                    Boardman is a leisure game that seeks to solve the problem that shows up in our everyday conversations. 
                This problem comes from our believe that our prediction skill is better the next man's. You'd observe this, 
                in the course of our interaction with our friends, family and even enemies.
                We challenge them on bets. Sometimes, we are even willing to stake monies, if the other party agrees to it. 
                And many a time, this fails to happen because a trusted third party is either absent or cannot be relied upon.

                This is where boardman comes in. Board man is a platform, that enables you place real bets against anybody. When a winner is establised, 
                    boardman pays the winner immediately.

                Note: This is the beta version of boardman. You can only bet football matches against an A.I
